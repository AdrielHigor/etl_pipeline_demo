# Building a Scalable Serverless AWS ETL Pipeline with Lambda, S3, and Redshift Spectrum

## Overview

When working on data-driven projects, building a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is both essential and challenging. You often need to extract data from third-party sources, public APIs, or even CSV files shared by other teams. However, before this data becomes useful, it typically requires cleaning, validation, and transformation so that it can be loaded into a data warehouse where it can be used for data analysis, machine learning, dashboards, and more.

This post will walk you through the process of building a serverless ETL pipeline using AWS, Lambda Functions, S3, and Redshift Spectrum.
